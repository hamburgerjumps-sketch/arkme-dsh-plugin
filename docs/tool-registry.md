# Arkme Tool Registry

Arkme classifies model-facing tools before compiling them into the DSH `ToolDefinition` registry. DSH remains the owner of schemas, execution, scope visibility, guards, duplicate detection and lifecycle disposal.

## Profiles

- `business`: system tools plus user-goal-oriented Arkme tools. This is the default and preserves the existing tool surface.
- `atomic`: system tools plus owner-specific primitive tools. No atomic tools ship yet.
- `hybrid`: system, business and atomic tools.
- `disabled`: no Arkme model tools or Arkme tool prompt.

Every module declares an internal versioned ID, model-facing tool name, `system`/`business`/`atomic` kind, dependency phase, read/write effect, required grant and profiles. The static Catalog rejects duplicate IDs/names, invalid category/profile combinations and writes without explicit grant ownership.

## Registration phases

`core` modules register immediately. `attachments` modules register only inside the DSH attachments injection fiber, so dependency disposal withdraws the tools and remounting restores them. The Registrar checks that every materialized `ToolDefinition.name` matches the Catalog metadata before handing it to DSH.

## Composition rule

Business and atomic tools share typed application Ports; a business tool must not invoke another tool's `execute()` method. This keeps authorization, cancellation, logging and output projection owned by one model tool call.

Per-tool instructions stay in `ToolDefinition.description`. Cross-tool guidance is selected by Profile and registered in the same Arkme registrar. Prompt text must not name a tool outside the selected Profile or an unavailable dependency phase; attachment guidance appears and disappears with the attachment-backed tool. Prompt visibility is not authorization: write metadata declares ownership, and the one-time Arkme ID mutation additionally installs a DSH `tools/pre-execute` approval decision before execution. Other write grants remain available for a future shared guard resolver.

## Extension preview gallery Tools

Business and hybrid profiles expose `arkme_extension_preview_add`, `arkme_extension_preview_delete`, and `arkme_extension_preview_reorder`. Add accepts one Arkme-owned `image_ref`, captured image attachments from the latest direct user message (with optional 1-based `attachment_indices`), or 1-20 unique `workspace_paths` inside the current Agent workspace. Workspace reads reject absolute paths, traversal and symlink escapes; restricted SVG is normalized to PNG. `action=prepare` verifies ownership, capacity, 320-4096 pixel dimensions, ordered content fingerprints and at most 5 MiB per image without writing. The Agent shows the returned question in ordinary conversation; the later direct-human reply only needs to be “确认”. `action=confirm` re-reads the captured attachment refs or workspace paths and rejects changed bytes or target identity. A different prepare cannot replace an unconfirmed operation. Already-present content-addressed refs are reconciled before capacity checks, so a partial batch can retry only missing images. Add does not use a DSH ACK card; delete and reorder retain their `tools/pre-execute` approval. Results contain only the safe ordered gallery and revision—never attachment ids, `image_ref`, base64, workspace paths, object keys, signed URLs, or signed headers. Atomic and disabled profiles expose none of these Tools.

## Group member Tools

Business and hybrid profiles expose `arkme_group_member_candidates` and `arkme_group_member_add`. Candidate discovery accepts only an account-bound group `source_ref`, excludes current members and returns signed, opaque `candidate_ref` values for people from the signed-in user's private chats. The write Tool accepts 1-20 unchanged candidate refs, requires explicit-user-write confirmation, reports each outcome independently, and sends private invitation links when the group's join policy requires approval. Raw user IDs are never exposed to the model.

## Topic batch Tools

Business and hybrid profiles expose `arkme_topics_create` for root topics and `arkme_topic_children_create` for direct children. Both accept 1-20 final titles, require a later conversational confirmation, derive stable per-call mutation identities, and return one owner receipt per title. Child creation additionally requires an unchanged topic `source_ref` from `arkme_sources_list`; title matching is never used to guess the parent. The Record owner executes each batch sequentially. Only the same stable mutation identity can produce an idempotent success; an active same-name topic with a different identity is left untouched and reported as a failed item. The owner verifies child placement after writing and cleans up only a topic newly accepted by the failed item. `outcome_unknown` is never presented as success or retried automatically.

## Adding a tool

1. Add one module under `src/tools/business`, `src/tools/atomic` or `src/tools/system`.
2. Depend on the narrow Port, not `ArkmeService` or another tool module.
3. Export it from the layer's static `index.ts` and add it to the ordered Catalog list.
4. Declare `effect: 'write'` with `grant: 'explicit-user-write'` for mutations.
5. Add module behavior tests plus Catalog/Profile visibility assertions.
6. If cross-tool guidance changes, assert every referenced tool is visible in that Profile.
